## Milestone: Drag Drop Reorder

### Goals
- Implement fluid drag-and-drop reordering for the project list
- Support both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) interactions
- Provide rich visual feedback during drag operations
- Ensure smooth performance and animations
- Maintain data persistence with debounced auto-save

### Key Documents

- `PRD_Drag_Drop_Reorder.md` - Product requirements for drag-and-drop functionality
- `SPECS_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md` - Technical specifications for implementation

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Touch-based reordering works on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- ✅ Visual feedback includes: dragged item shadow, drop position indicator, smooth animations
- ✅ Reordered state persists to localStorage with debounced saving
- ✅ All animations run at 60fps without jank
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility implemented for reordering (nice-to-have)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with >90% code coverage for new functionality
- ✅ Integration tests verify drag-drop behavior and persistence
- ✅ No regression in existing timer functionality
- ✅ Code follows Angular 20 best practices and project conventions

### Notes / Context
- This is the first milestone for the WFH Time Tracker project
- Focuses on enhancing user experience with intuitive project organization
- Must maintain the existing smooth performance and simple architecture
- Timer state should remain unaffected during reordering operations
- Consider using Angular CDK drag-drop or implementing custom solution
- Debounce period should balance responsiveness with performance (suggested: 300-500ms)
