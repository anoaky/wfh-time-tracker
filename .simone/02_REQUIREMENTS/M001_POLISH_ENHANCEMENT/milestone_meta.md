## Milestone: Polish & Enhancement

### Goals
- Implement data export functionality to allow users to export their time tracking data
- Reorganize the project list for better usability (sorting, filtering, or grouping options)
- Enhance animations and transitions for a more polished user experience
- Expand test coverage to ensure reliability of new and existing features

### Key Documents

- `PRD_POLISH_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Product requirements for all enhancement features
- `SPECS_DATA_EXPORT.md` - Technical specifications for export functionality
- `SPECS_PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md` - Technical specifications for project list improvements
- `SPECS_ANIMATIONS.md` - Animation and transition enhancement specifications

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- Data export feature implemented with at least CSV and JSON format support
- Project list can be sorted by at least name and total time
- All interactive elements have smooth transitions and appropriate feedback animations
- Test coverage increased to > 85% with all new features fully tested
- All features work responsively across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- No regression in existing functionality
- Documentation updated to reflect new features

### Notes / Context
- This milestone focuses on enhancing the existing working application rather than adding major new features
- Priority should be given to user-facing improvements that enhance daily usage
- All enhancements should maintain the app's simplicity and privacy-focused approach
- Consider accessibility throughout all improvements
