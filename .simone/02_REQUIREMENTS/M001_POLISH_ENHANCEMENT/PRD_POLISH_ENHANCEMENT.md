# Product Requirements Document - Polish & Enhancement

## Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for enhancing the WFH Time Tracker with data export capabilities, improved project organization, refined animations, and expanded testing coverage.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Data Export Functionality

#### User Story
As a user, I want to export my time tracking data so that I can analyze it in other tools or keep backups.

#### Requirements
- **Export Formats**:
  - CSV format for spreadsheet compatibility
  - JSON format for data portability
  - Optional: PDF summary report

- **Export Options**:
  - Export all projects
  - Export selected projects
  - Date range filtering (optional for initial release)

- **CSV Format Specification**:
  ```csv
  Project Name,Total Time (seconds),Total Time (formatted),Last Updated
  "Project A",3600,"01:00:00","2025-06-18"
  ```

- **JSON Format Specification**:
  ```json
  {
    "exportDate": "2025-06-18T10:30:00Z",
    "projects": [
      {
        "name": "Project A",
        "elapsedTime": 3600,
        "formattedTime": "01:00:00"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **UI Requirements**:
  - Export button in the main interface
  - Modal or dropdown for format selection
  - Clear download feedback

### 2. Project List Organization

#### User Story
As a user, I want to organize my projects so that I can quickly find and prioritize my work.

#### Requirements
- **Sorting Options**:
  - By project name (A-Z, Z-A)
  - By total time (ascending, descending)
  - By creation date (if tracked)
  - By last activity (if tracked)

- **Visual Organization**:
  - Clear sort indicator
  - Smooth reordering animations
  - Persistent sort preference

- **Search/Filter** (Optional):
  - Quick search by project name
  - Filter active vs inactive projects

- **UI Requirements**:
  - Sort dropdown or toggle buttons
  - Visual feedback during sorting
  - Mobile-friendly controls

### 3. Animation Improvements

#### User Story
As a user, I want smooth, polished animations that make the app feel professional and responsive.

#### Requirements
- **Timer Animations**:
  - Smooth start/stop transitions
  - Enhanced pulse effect for running timers
  - Number tick animations for time updates

- **List Animations**:
  - Smooth add/remove project animations
  - Reorder animations when sorting
  - Stagger effects for initial load

- **Interaction Feedback**:
  - Button press animations
  - Hover state transitions
  - Success/error state animations

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - 60fps animations
  - GPU-accelerated where appropriate
  - Reduced motion option for accessibility

### 4. Testing Expansion

#### User Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability and ease future development.

#### Requirements
- **Coverage Goals**:
  - Increase from current ~70% to >85%
  - 100% coverage for new features
  - Critical path coverage for all user flows

- **Test Categories**:
  - Export functionality tests
  - Sorting algorithm tests
  - Animation trigger tests
  - Integration tests for new features
  - Edge case handling

- **Test Infrastructure**:
  - Mock localStorage for export tests
  - Animation testing utilities
  - Performance benchmarks for sorting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Export operations < 2 seconds for 100 projects
- Sorting operations < 100ms for 50 projects
- Animations maintain 60fps

### Accessibility
- All new features keyboard accessible
- ARIA labels for new controls
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Browser Support
- Maintain current browser support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Success Metrics
- Export feature used by >50% of users within first month
- Sorting feature adoption >70%
- No performance regression reports
- Test suite execution time < 30 seconds

## Out of Scope
- Cloud sync functionality
- User accounts/authentication
- Real-time collaboration
- Advanced reporting/analytics
- Project templates
- Time goals/budgets

## Dependencies
- Current Angular 20 signals architecture
- Existing localStorage implementation
- Tailwind CSS v4 capabilities

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Large datasets might slow down export
  - **Mitigation**: Implement streaming/chunked export for large datasets

- **Risk**: Complex animations might impact performance
  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, implement reduced motion mode

- **Risk**: Sort preferences might conflict with real-time updates
  - **Mitigation**: Clear UX for manual vs auto-sort modes
