# Product Requirements Document: Angular V20 Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for migrating the WFH Time Tracker application from Angular v19 to Angular v20.

## Background
The WFH Time Tracker is currently built on Angular v19.2.0. With the release of Angular v20, we need to upgrade to:
- Stay current with the Angular ecosystem
- Access new features and improvements
- Benefit from performance optimizations
- Ensure continued security updates and support

## User Impact
This migration should be transparent to end users with:
- No changes to existing functionality
- No changes to the user interface
- Potential performance improvements
- Enhanced stability

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Core Framework Update
- Update all @angular/* packages to v20.x.x
- Update Angular CLI to v20.x.x
- Maintain all existing application features

### FR2: Dependency Compatibility
- Update all dependencies to Angular v20 compatible versions
- Resolve any peer dependency conflicts
- Update development dependencies as required

### FR3: Code Migration
- Apply any required code changes for v20 compatibility
- Update deprecated APIs to new recommended patterns
- Ensure TypeScript compatibility with required version

### FR4: Configuration Updates
- Update angular.json for v20 compatibility
- Update TypeScript configuration as needed
- Update build configuration for new features

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Application performance must not degrade
- Bundle size should remain the same or decrease
- Initial load time should remain the same or improve

### NFR2: Compatibility
- Maintain browser compatibility matrix
- Ensure localStorage data format compatibility
- Support same deployment environments

### NFR3: Testing
- All existing tests must pass
- No reduction in code coverage
- Add tests for any new v20-specific features used

### NFR4: Development Experience
- Migration process should be documented
- Development workflow should remain unchanged
- Build times should not significantly increase

## Constraints
- Migration must be completed without data loss
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Deployment process must remain unchanged
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CI/CD pipeline

## Success Metrics
- Zero user-reported issues post-migration
- All automated tests passing
- No performance regressions
- Successful deployment to all environments

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Breaking Changes**: Review migration guide thoroughly
2. **Third-party Dependencies**: Check compatibility before starting
3. **Build Issues**: Test in isolated environment first
4. **Runtime Errors**: Comprehensive testing before deployment

## Timeline
- Research and Planning: 1 day
- Implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1-2 days
- Deployment: 1 day

Total estimated effort: 1 week
