# Task: Unit Testing Coverage for Export Functionality

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for all export functionality components to achieve 100% test coverage. This includes testing the ExportService, ExportButtonComponent, and AppComponent integration with export features. The testing strategy should follow existing patterns in the codebase, properly mock external dependencies (localStorage, Blob API, file downloads), and cover all edge cases including error scenarios.

Based on codebase analysis, the project uses:
- **Testing Framework**: Jasmine with Karma (Angular 20 default)
- **Test Runner**: ChromeHeadless via Angular CLI
- **Testing Patterns**: Angular TestBed for component testing, comprehensive localStorage mocking, signal-based testing
- **Existing Coverage**: Strong test coverage for core components (AppComponent, ProjectItemComponent, ProjectData)

## Goal / Objectives
Achieve comprehensive test coverage for the export functionality ensuring reliability, maintainability, and robust error handling.

- Achieve 100% line and branch coverage for ExportService
- Achieve 100% line and branch coverage for ExportButtonComponent  
- Achieve comprehensive integration testing for AppComponent export features
- Implement proper mocking strategies for all external dependencies
- Cover all edge cases and error scenarios
- Follow established testing patterns and conventions from existing codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ExportService unit tests achieve 100% coverage with all methods tested
- [ ] ExportButtonComponent unit tests achieve 100% coverage including UI interactions
- [ ] AppComponent integration tests cover all export-related functionality
- [ ] All external dependencies (localStorage, Blob, URL.createObjectURL, etc.) are properly mocked
- [ ] Edge cases tested: empty projects, large datasets, malformed data, export errors
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback mechanisms are tested
- [ ] Accessibility features in export components are tested
- [ ] Performance considerations for large exports are validated
- [ ] Error handling scenarios produce appropriate user feedback
- [ ] All tests follow existing codebase patterns (TestBed setup, signal testing, etc.)

## Subtasks
- [ ] **Create ExportService unit tests (export.service.spec.ts)**
  - Test CSV export format generation with various project data scenarios
  - Test JSON export format generation with comprehensive data validation
  - Mock Blob constructor and URL.createObjectURL for file generation testing
  - Test error handling for malformed project data
  - Test performance with large datasets (1000+ projects simulation)
  - Validate export filename generation with timestamps
  - Test export data sanitization and formatting

- [ ] **Create ExportButtonComponent unit tests (export-button.component.spec.ts)**
  - Test component initialization and default state
  - Test CSV export button click handling and loading states
  - Test JSON export button click handling and loading states
  - Mock ExportService dependency and verify service method calls
  - Test loading indicator display during export operations
  - Test error state handling and user feedback
  - Test accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Test responsive behavior and styling states
  - Test disabled states when no projects exist

- [ ] **Create AppComponent integration tests for export functionality**
  - Extend existing app.component.spec.ts with export integration tests
  - Test export button rendering when projects exist
  - Test export button hiding when no projects exist
  - Test export functionality with localStorage project data
  - Test export operations with multiple projects and varying elapsed times
  - Validate export data matches current project state
  - Test export operations during active timers
  - Test memory cleanup after export operations

- [ ] **Create comprehensive mock strategies**
  - Mock Blob constructor for file generation testing
  - Mock URL.createObjectURL and URL.revokeObjectURL
  - Mock document.createElement and appendChild for download links
  - Mock localStorage for consistent test data
  - Create test data fixtures for various project scenarios
  - Mock Date.now() for consistent timestamp testing
  - Create helper functions for common test setup

- [ ] **Implement edge case and error testing**
  - Test export with empty project list
  - Test export with corrupted localStorage data
  - Test export with extremely large project names (1000+ characters)
  - Test export with projects having zero elapsed time
  - Test export with projects having maximum elapsed time values
  - Test network/file system errors during download
  - Test browser compatibility issues (older browser simulation)
  - Test memory limitations with large export datasets

- [ ] **Performance and load testing**
  - Test export performance with 100, 500, 1000+ projects
  - Test memory usage during large export operations
  - Test UI responsiveness during export processing
  - Validate export completion within acceptable time limits
  - Test cleanup of temporary objects and event listeners

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Testing Framework Setup
Based on existing codebase analysis:
```typescript
// Follow existing patterns from app.component.spec.ts
beforeEach(async () => {
    // Mock localStorage consistently
    mockLocalStorage = {};
    spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem').and.callFake(...);
    spyOn(localStorage, 'setItem').and.callFake(...);
    
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
        imports: [ComponentName],
        providers: [ExportService] // or mock as needed
    }).compileComponents();
});
```

### Mock Strategy Patterns
```typescript
// Mock Blob constructor
const mockBlob = jasmine.createSpy('Blob').and.returnValue({
    size: 1234,
    type: 'text/csv'
});
(window as any).Blob = mockBlob;

// Mock URL methods
spyOn(URL, 'createObjectURL').and.returnValue('mock-url');
spyOn(URL, 'revokeObjectURL');

// Mock DOM elements for download
const mockLink = jasmine.createSpyObj('a', ['click', 'remove']);
spyOn(document, 'createElement').and.returnValue(mockLink);
```

### Signal Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Follow existing signal testing from project-item.component.spec.ts
it('should update export state signal', () => {
    expect(component.isExporting()).toBe(false);
    component.startExport();
    expect(component.isExporting()).toBe(true);
});
```

### Integration Testing Approach
- Extend existing AppComponent tests rather than creating separate files
- Use ComponentFixture.debugElement.query() for DOM element testing
- Follow existing patterns for component input/output testing
- Maintain consistency with existing localStorage mocking strategies

### Coverage Requirements
- Line coverage: 100% for all export-related code
- Branch coverage: 100% including all error paths
- Function coverage: 100% for all export service methods
- Statement coverage: 100% for all conditional logic

### Testing Data Fixtures
Create reusable test data following existing patterns:
```typescript
const mockProjects = [
    { name: 'Project 1', elapsedTime: 3600 },
    { name: 'Project 2', elapsedTime: 7200 }
];
```

This task builds upon the solid testing foundation already established in the codebase and ensures the new export functionality maintains the same high quality and reliability standards.
