# Task: ExportButton Component Implementation

## Description
Create a standalone Angular component that provides an intuitive dropdown interface for users to export their project data. The component will integrate with the ExportService to enable data export in multiple formats (CSV/JSON) while providing excellent user experience through loading states, error handling, and responsive design. The component follows the established patterns in the codebase using Angular signals, Tailwind CSS styling, and modern component architecture.

## Goal / Objectives
Implement a fully functional export button component that enhances the time tracker application with data export capabilities while maintaining consistency with existing UI patterns and architecture.

- Create a responsive dropdown export interface that matches the application's design language
- Integrate seamlessly with the ExportService dependency for actual export functionality  
- Provide clear user feedback during export operations (loading states, success/error messages)
- Ensure accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
- Support conditional rendering based on project data availability
- Maintain consistency with existing component patterns and styling approaches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Component is implemented as a standalone Angular component with proper imports
- [x] Accepts projects data as @Input() from parent AppComponent
- [x] Uses Angular signals for internal state management (dropdown open/closed, loading state)
- [x] Provides dropdown interface with CSV and JSON export options
- [x] Integrates with ExportService for actual export operations
- [x] Shows loading spinner/state during export operations
- [x] Displays success feedback after successful export
- [x] Shows error messages for failed export operations
- [x] Implements keyboard navigation (Enter/Escape keys) for accessibility
- [x] Includes proper ARIA attributes for screen reader support
- [x] Only renders when projects exist (conditional display)
- [x] Follows established Tailwind CSS styling patterns from existing components
- [x] Responsive design works across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- [x] Component properly handles cleanup (subscriptions, event listeners)

## Subtasks
- [x] Create component files (export-button.component.ts, .html, .css if needed)
- [x] Define component interface with @Input() for projects and dependency injection for ExportService
- [x] Implement Angular signals for state management (isDropdownOpen, isExporting, exportError, exportSuccess)
- [x] Create dropdown UI template with format selection options matching existing component styles
- [x] Implement click handlers for dropdown toggle and export format selection
- [x] Add keyboard event handlers for accessibility (Enter/Escape keys)
- [x] Integrate with ExportService for CSV export functionality
- [x] Integrate with ExportService for JSON export functionality
- [x] Implement loading state UI with spinner or progress indicator
- [x] Add success feedback display with auto-dismiss functionality
- [x] Implement error state display with user-friendly error messages
- [x] Add proper ARIA attributes and accessibility features
- [x] Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- [x] Add conditional rendering based on projects array length
- [x] Test component integration with AppComponent
- [x] Verify proper cleanup of subscriptions and event listeners

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Architecture
Based on analysis of existing components (`AddProjectFormComponent`, `ProjectItemComponent`), follow these patterns:
- Use standalone component with `imports: []` array
- Import required Angular modules (CommonModule may be needed for *ngIf/@if directives)
- Use `input<>()` for props and `output<>()` for events
- Implement Angular signals with `signal()` for reactive state management
- Use computed signals where appropriate for derived state

### State Management with Signals
```typescript
// Example signal structure based on existing patterns
isDropdownOpen = signal(false);
isExporting = signal(false);
exportError = signal<string | null>(null);
exportSuccess = signal(false);
```

### Styling Patterns
Follow established Tailwind CSS patterns from existing components:
- Use rounded-2xl for container borders
- Apply shadow-lg for primary containers, shadow-md for interactive elements
- Use bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 for main backgrounds
- Apply border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700 for borders
- Use hover:scale-105 and transition-all duration-300 for interactive elements
- Follow color scheme: blue-600/purple-600 gradients for primary actions
- Use text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 for secondary text

### Button and Dropdown Design
Based on existing button patterns in `AddProjectFormComponent` and `ProjectItemComponent`:
- Primary button with gradient background when active
- Rounded-xl buttons with proper padding (px-4 py-2.5 or similar)
- Hover effects with scale transformations and shadow changes
- Focus states with ring-4 focus rings
- Proper disabled states with cursor-not-allowed and muted colors

### Integration Points
- Component will be imported and used in `AppComponent`
- Projects data passed via `[projects]="projectList()"` binding
- ExportService injected via constructor dependency injection
- Component should handle empty project arrays gracefully

### Accessibility Requirements
Following patterns from existing components:
- Add aria-label attributes to buttons
- Implement keyboard navigation (Enter to select, Escape to close)
- Use proper ARIA expanded/collapsed states for dropdown
- Ensure focus management for dropdown interactions
- Include descriptive text for screen readers

### Error Handling
- Catch and display ExportService errors in user-friendly format
- Implement auto-dismiss for success messages (similar to form validation patterns)
- Show loading states to prevent multiple simultaneous export attempts
- Handle edge cases like empty project data gracefully
