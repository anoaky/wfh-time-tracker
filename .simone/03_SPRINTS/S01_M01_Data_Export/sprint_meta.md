# Sprint: Sprint 1 - Data Export Functionality (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Implement complete data export functionality allowing users to export their time tracking data in CSV and JSON formats for backup and analysis purposes.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- ExportService class with CSV and JSON generation logic
- ExportButtonComponent with responsive dropdown interface
- File download handling using Blob API with proper error management
- Integration with existing AppComponent and project list
- Comprehensive unit tests achieving 100% coverage for export functionality
- User feedback and loading states during export operations

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can export project data in both CSV and JSON formats
- Export button appears only when projects exist in the application
- CSV format follows specified schema: Project Name, Total Time (seconds), Total Time (formatted), Export Date
- JSON format includes proper metadata (exportDate, version) and structured project data
- File downloads trigger successfully across all supported browsers
- Export operations complete in under 2 seconds for datasets up to 100 projects
- All new export functionality has 100% unit test coverage
- Error handling provides clear user feedback for failed export operations
- Integration with existing AppComponent requires no breaking changes

## Task List

### T01_S01_ExportService_Implementation (Medium Complexity)
- Implement injectable ExportService with CSV/JSON generation
- File download handling using Blob API 
- Data retrieval from localStorage with error handling
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### T02_S01_ExportButton_Component (Medium Complexity)  
- Create responsive ExportButtonComponent with dropdown interface
- Angular signals-based state management
- Integration with ExportService for format selection
- Loading states and user feedback implementation

### T03_S01_AppComponent_Integration (Low Complexity)
- Integrate ExportButtonComponent into AppComponent template
- Conditional rendering when projects exist
- Data binding and component positioning
- Maintain existing functionality without breaking changes

### T04_S01_Unit_Testing_Coverage (Medium Complexity)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all export functionality
- 100% test coverage for ExportService and ExportButtonComponent
- Mock strategies for localStorage and Blob API
- Edge case and error scenario testing

### T05_S01_Error_Handling_UX (Medium Complexity)
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Loading indicators and success/failure feedback
- Accessibility enhancements for all user states
- Performance monitoring and timeout handling

**Total Tasks:** 5 (1 Low, 4 Medium complexity)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint has complete technical specifications (SPECS_DATA_EXPORT.md) and is ready for immediate implementation
- No dependencies on other M01 features - can be developed and deployed independently
- High user value delivery - enables data backup and external analysis capabilities
- Foundation for potential future export enhancements (PDF, date filtering)
