# Sprint: Migration Preparation (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Research Angular v20 changes, document current state, and prepare migration environment

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Document current package versions and configurations
- Research Angular v20 breaking changes and migration guide
- Create migration branch for safe experimentation
- Backup critical configuration files
- Identify potential compatibility issues with current dependencies

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Migration branch created and ready for work
- Current state documented in detail
- Angular v20 breaking changes research completed
- Dependency compatibility matrix created
- Migration risks identified and documented

## Tasks

### T01 - Document Current State
**File**: `T01_S01_Document_Current_State.md`
**Complexity**: Low
**Goal**: Document all current package versions and configurations before migration

### T02 - Research Angular v20
**File**: `T02_S01_Research_Angular_v20.md`
**Complexity**: Medium
**Goal**: Research Angular v20 breaking changes and migration requirements

### T03 - Setup Migration Branch
**File**: `T03_S01_Setup_Migration_Branch.md`
**Complexity**: Low
**Goal**: Create dedicated migration branch for safe experimentation

### T04 - Backup Configuration
**File**: `T04_S01_Backup_Configuration.md`
**Complexity**: Low
**Goal**: Backup all critical configuration files before migration

### T05 - Analyze Dependencies
**File**: `T05_S01_Analyze_Dependencies.md`
**Complexity**: Medium
**Goal**: Identify potential compatibility issues with current dependencies for Angular v20

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on preparation to minimize risk during actual migration
- No code changes should be made to main branch during this sprint
