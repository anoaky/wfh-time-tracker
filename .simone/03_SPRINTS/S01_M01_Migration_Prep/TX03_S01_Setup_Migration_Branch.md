- **Task ID**: T03
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: Low

- **Completed**: 2025-06-18 13:44

## Task Goal
Create dedicated migration branch for safe experimentation

## Context & Background
Before beginning the Angular standalone migration, we need to establish a safe branching strategy that allows for experimentation while preserving the main branch. This task focuses on setting up proper git workflows for the migration process.

## Research Findings

### Current Git Structure
- **Current Branch**: `main` (single branch repository)
- **Remote Configuration**: No remote repositories configured (local-only repository)
- **Recent Activity**: Latest commits show active development with firebase integration and testing setup
- **Git Status**: Several modified and deleted files in working directory

### CI/CD Configuration Analysis
- **GitHub Actions**: No `.github/workflows` directory found in project root
- **Configuration Files**: No CI/CD configuration files (`.yml`, `.yaml`) found in project root
- **Package Scripts**: Standard Angular CLI scripts (`ng serve`, `ng build`, `ng test`)
- **Dependencies**: No deployment or CI-specific dependencies detected

### Branch Protection Considerations
- **Current Setup**: No branch protection rules (local repository only)
- **Remote Integration**: No remote repository configured, so no GitHub/GitLab branch protection applies
- **Local Workflow**: Simple single-branch development currently in use

## Technical Guidance

### Git Branching Strategy for Migration
1. **Feature Branch Approach**: Create a dedicated `feature/standalone-migration` branch
2. **Isolation Strategy**: Keep migration work completely separate from main branch
3. **Incremental Commits**: Make small, focused commits for each migration step
4. **Checkpoint Strategy**: Create backup branches at major milestones

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Main Branch**: `feature/standalone-migration` (primary migration work)
- **Backup Branches**: `backup/pre-migration-YYYYMMDD` (checkpoint branches)
- **Experiment Branches**: `experiment/migration-<component-name>` (for testing specific migrations)
- **Integration Branch**: `integration/standalone-migration` (for testing full migration)

### Safe Experimental Environment Setup
1. **Working Directory Cleanup**: Commit or stash current changes before branching
2. **Branch Isolation**: Ensure migration work doesn't affect main development
3. **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain clear path back to stable main branch
4. **Testing Environment**: Use migration branch for all testing and validation

### Integration with Existing Git Workflow
- **No Conflicts**: Current single-branch workflow won't be disrupted
- **Local Development**: Migration branch allows continued main branch development
- **Future Remote Setup**: Branch structure will be compatible with future remote repository setup
- **Merge Strategy**: Plan for clean merge back to main when migration is complete

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Branch Creation Process
1. **Prepare Current State**:
   ```bash
   # Check current status
   git status
   
   # Commit or stash any pending changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: save current state before migration branch"
   ```

2. **Create Migration Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Create and switch to migration branch
   git checkout -b feature/standalone-migration
   
   # Verify branch creation
   git branch
   ```

3. **Create Backup Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Switch back to main and create backup
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b backup/pre-migration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   git checkout feature/standalone-migration
   ```

### Isolation from Main Branch
- **Branch Switching**: Use `git checkout main` to return to stable state
- **Change Isolation**: Migration changes only exist in feature branch
- **Independent Development**: Main branch remains available for urgent fixes
- **Clean Separation**: No merge conflicts with ongoing development

### Backup Considerations Before Branching
1. **Current State Preservation**: Commit all current changes before creating migration branch
2. **Tagged Backups**: Create tagged backup branches at major milestones
3. **Local Repository Backup**: Consider creating full repository backup before major changes
4. **Recovery Strategy**: Document rollback procedures for each migration step

### Testing Branch Setup
1. **Testing Isolation**: Run all tests in migration branch only
2. **Build Verification**: Ensure `ng build` works in migration branch
3. **Development Server**: Test `ng serve` functionality in migration branch
4. **Comparison Testing**: Compare behavior between main and migration branches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Migration branch `feature/standalone-migration` created successfully
- [x] Backup branch `backup/pre-migration-20250618` created with current state
- [x] Working directory is clean in migration branch
- [x] Branch switching between main and migration works correctly
- [x] Documentation of branch strategy and rollback procedures complete

## Dependencies
- Clean working directory (commit or stash current changes)
- Understanding of current project state and recent commits

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Loss of current work during branch creation
  - **Mitigation**: Commit all changes before creating branches
- **Risk**: Confusion between branches during development
  - **Mitigation**: Clear naming conventions and branch status checking
- **Risk**: Difficulty merging back to main
  - **Mitigation**: Keep migration commits focused and well-documented
