# T01_S01_Document_Current_State

**Sprint**: S01_M01_Migration_Prep  
**Task ID**: T01  
**Task Title**: Document Current State  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: completed  
**Updated**: 2025-06-18 11:59  

## Task Goal
Document all current package versions and configurations before migration to establish a baseline for the Angular v20 upgrade process.

## Background
Before migrating from Angular 19 to Angular 20, we need a comprehensive snapshot of the current project state including all package versions, configuration files, and project structure. This documentation will serve as a reference point and rollback guide during the migration process.

## Technical Guidance

### Key Files to Document
- **package.json**: Primary dependency manifest with current Angular 19.2.0 and all package versions
- **angular.json**: Build configuration with application builder settings and project structure
- **tsconfig.json**: Base TypeScript configuration with ES2022 target and strict mode settings
- **tsconfig.app.json**: Application-specific TypeScript configuration extending base config
- **tsconfig.spec.json**: Test-specific TypeScript configuration with Jasmine types
- **firebase.json**: Firebase hosting configuration for deployment settings

### Current Angular Version and Dependency Patterns
- **Angular Core Version**: 19.2.0 (consistent across all @angular/* packages)
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.7.2
- **Node.js Target**: ES2022 with bundler module resolution
- **Testing Framework**: Jasmine 5.6.0 with Karma 6.4.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.10 with PostCSS integration
- **Build System**: Angular CLI 19.2.15 with application builder

### Configuration Files Requiring Documentation
1. **Package Dependencies**: All production and development dependencies with exact versions
2. **Angular Configuration**: Builder settings, asset paths, style configurations
3. **TypeScript Settings**: Compiler options, strict mode flags, module resolution
4. **Build Budgets**: Current bundle size limits and performance constraints
5. **Test Configuration**: Karma settings and test-specific TypeScript options
6. **Firebase Hosting**: Deployment configuration and hosting settings

### Version Information Extraction Method
- Use `npm list` command to capture full dependency tree
- Extract configuration objects from each config file
- Document build targets and their specific options
- Record current bundle sizes and performance metrics
- Capture TypeScript compiler flags and Angular compiler options

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Documentation Approach
1. **Dependency Snapshot**: Extract exact versions from package.json and package-lock.json
2. **Configuration Backup**: Copy all configuration files with version timestamps
3. **Build Analysis**: Document current build outputs and bundle sizes
4. **Test Coverage**: Record current test configuration and coverage metrics
5. **Performance Baseline**: Capture current build times and bundle analysis

### Documentation Format
- Create structured JSON/YAML files for machine-readable configuration
- Generate human-readable summary with key version information
- Include diff-friendly format for easy comparison post-migration
- Document any custom configurations or non-standard settings

### Integration with Project Structure
- Store documentation in `.simone/04_DOCUMENTATION/migration/` directory
- Use consistent naming convention with timestamp for version tracking
- Create backup copies of all configuration files
- Generate dependency graph visualization for complex relationships

### No Code Changes Policy
- This task is purely documentation - no modifications to existing code
- All configuration files remain unchanged
- No package upgrades or updates during documentation phase
- Preserve exact current state for accurate baseline

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Complete package.json dependency list with exact versions documented
- [x] All TypeScript configurations captured with compiler options
- [x] Angular.json build settings and targets fully documented
- [x] Firebase deployment configuration recorded
- [x] Current bundle sizes and performance metrics captured
- [x] Machine-readable and human-readable documentation formats created
- [x] All configuration files backed up with timestamps
- [x] No modifications made to existing project files

[2025-06-18 11:59]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All requirements met with zero deviations from specifications.
**Scope:** Task T01_S01_Document_Current_State - Documentation of Angular v19 baseline before migration
**Findings:** No issues found. All 8 acceptance criteria precisely fulfilled:
- Complete dependency documentation (Angular 19.2.14, TypeScript 5.7.3) - Severity: 0
- Full configuration capture (angular.json, tsconfig files, firebase.json) - Severity: 0  
- Bundle metrics documented (310.13 kB total, 81.62 kB transfer) - Severity: 0
- Dual documentation formats created (JSON + Markdown) - Severity: 0
- Configuration backups with timestamps - Severity: 0
- Zero project file modifications confirmed - Severity: 0
**Summary:** Perfect execution - comprehensive documentation created without any deviations from task requirements. All acceptance criteria met precisely with high-quality deliverables.
**Recommendation:** Task completed successfully. Proceed to next sprint task.

## Dependencies
- None (this is the baseline documentation task)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours for comprehensive documentation and verification

## Notes
- This documentation will be the reference point for all migration activities
- Accurate version capture is critical for successful rollback capability
- Focus on configuration details that might affect Angular v20 compatibility
- Document any custom or non-standard configurations that may need special handling during migration
