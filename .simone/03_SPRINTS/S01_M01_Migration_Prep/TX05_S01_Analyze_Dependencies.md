## Description

Identify potential compatibility issues with current dependencies for Angular v20. This task involves a comprehensive analysis of all project dependencies to assess their compatibility with Angular v20 and identify any potential migration blockers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete inventory of all current dependencies documented
- [x] Compatibility status verified for each dependency with Angular v20
- [x] Risk assessment completed for incompatible dependencies
- [x] Alternative solutions identified for high-risk dependencies
- [x] Compatibility matrix document created and reviewed
- [x] Dependency update strategy documented

## Technical Guidance

### Dependency Analysis Process

1. **Extract Current Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Generate dependency tree
   npm list --depth=0 > dependency-list.txt
   
   # Check for outdated packages
   npm outdated
   ```

2. **Angular-Specific Dependencies to Check**
   - @angular/core and all @angular/* packages
   - @angular/cli and @angular-devkit/*
   - @angular/fire (if using Firebase)
   - Angular Material (@angular/material)
   - Angular CDK (@angular/cdk)
   - Zone.js compatibility

3. **Compatibility Research Tools**
   - npm view [package] versions (check available versions)
   - Package GitHub repositories for v20 compatibility issues
   - Angular Update Guide: https://update.angular.io/
   - npm-check-updates tool for dependency analysis

4. **Key Dependencies Focus Areas**
   ```
   Priority 1 - Core Angular:
   - @angular/animations
   - @angular/common
   - @angular/compiler
   - @angular/core
   - @angular/forms
   - @angular/platform-browser
   - @angular/platform-browser-dynamic
   - @angular/router
   
   Priority 2 - Build Tools:
   - @angular-devkit/build-angular
   - @angular/cli
   - typescript
   - zone.js
   - rxjs
   
   Priority 3 - UI/Styling:
   - tailwindcss
   - postcss
   - autoprefixer
   
   Priority 4 - Testing:
   - karma
   - jasmine-core
   - @types/jasmine
   ```

### Compatibility Matrix Documentation Format

Create a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Angular v20 Dependency Compatibility Matrix

| Package | Current Version | v20 Compatible Version | Status | Risk Level | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|---------|------------|--------|
| @angular/core | 19.0.0 | 20.0.0 | ✅ Compatible | Low | Direct upgrade path |
| [package-name] | x.x.x | x.x.x or N/A | ❌/⚠️/✅ | High/Med/Low | Migration notes |
```

Status Legend:
- ✅ Compatible - Has v20 support
- ⚠️ Partial - May work but not officially supported
- ❌ Incompatible - No v20 support yet

## Implementation Notes

### Systematic Review Process

1. **Phase 1: Inventory (1 hour)**
   - Extract package.json dependencies
   - Categorize by type (Angular, UI, utilities, dev tools)
   - Note current version constraints

2. **Phase 2: Research (2 hours)**
   - Check each dependency's repository/npm page
   - Look for Angular v20 compatibility statements
   - Search for open issues mentioning Angular v20
   - Check dependency's own dependencies

3. **Phase 3: Risk Assessment (1 hour)**
   - Classify each dependency risk:
     - **High Risk**: Core functionality, no v20 support
     - **Medium Risk**: Important but has alternatives
     - **Low Risk**: Compatible or easily replaceable
   
4. **Documentation Format**:
   ```

   ### Summary
   - Total Dependencies: X
   - Compatible: X (X%)
   - Incompatible: X (X%)
   - Unknown: X (X%)
   
   ### High Risk Dependencies
   [List with mitigation strategies]
   
   ### Recommended Actions
   [Prioritized list of dependency updates]
   ```

### Research Resources

- Angular GitHub issues for v20 compatibility
- Package maintainer announcements
- Community forums and discussions
- Angular blog for official guidance

## Notes

- Some dependencies may not explicitly state v20 support yet
- Consider creating fallback plans for critical incompatible dependencies
- Document any workarounds discovered during research
- Keep track of dependencies that might need PRs for v20 support

## Task Relationships

**Depends On**: 
- Codebase analysis completion

**Enables**:
- T06_S01_Update_Dependencies
- Risk assessment for migration timeline
