# Sprint: Sprint 3 - Animation Polish & Enhanced UX (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Implement enhanced animations and interaction polish to create a professional, smooth user experience while maintaining 60fps performance and accessibility compliance.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Complete SPECS_ANIMATIONS.md technical specification document
- Enhanced timer animations with smooth start/stop transitions and improved pulse effects
- List animations for smooth add/remove projects and reordering transitions
- Button interaction feedback including hover states and press animations with scale transforms
- Performance optimization ensuring all animations maintain 60fps
- Accessibility compliance with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Animation performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Comprehensive tests for animation triggers and accessibility features

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All timer elements display smooth start/stop transitions with enhanced visual feedback
- Project list operations (add, remove, reorder) include fluid animations
- Interactive elements provide appropriate hover and press feedback animations
- All animations consistently maintain 60fps performance across supported devices
- Accessibility preferences are fully respected (users with prefers-reduced-motion see reduced animations)
- No animation conflicts, jarring transitions, or performance degradation
- Animation performance benchmarks are established and maintained
- All new animation functionality has appropriate test coverage
- Technical specification document (SPECS_ANIMATIONS.md) is complete with implementation details

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint should begin after core functionality from S01/S02 is stable to minimize animation conflicts
- Requires creation of SPECS_ANIMATIONS.md specification document before implementation
- Focuses on polish and professional user experience enhancement
- Performance is critical - animations must not impact application responsiveness
- Consider GPU acceleration opportunities and CSS transform optimizations
- Accessibility compliance is mandatory - reduced motion preferences must be respected
