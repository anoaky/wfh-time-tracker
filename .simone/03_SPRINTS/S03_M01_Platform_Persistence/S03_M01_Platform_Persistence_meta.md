# Sprint: Platform Persistence - Mobile Support & Data Persistence (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Add mobile touch support and implement debounced data persistence to localStorage.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement mobile touch drag behavior with 200ms threshold
- Configure CDK for touch interactions and prevent scroll conflicts
- Add debounced localStorage persistence with 300-500ms delay
- Implement error handling for storage failures and quota exceeded
- Optimize performance for mobile devices and large project lists
- Add touch-specific styling and feedback
- Test cross-platform compatibility (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Touch drag works smoothly on iOS Safari and Chrome Android
- Touch threshold of 200ms prevents accidental drags
- Scroll conflicts are resolved - users can still scroll the page normally
- Reorder changes persist to localStorage with debounced saving (300-500ms)
- Reordered state maintains across browser sessions and page reloads
- Storage error handling prevents data loss on quota exceeded
- Performance remains at 60fps on mobile devices
- Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (44x44px minimum)
- Works in both portrait and landscape orientations

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Requires working visual feedback system from S02
- Mobile testing should be done on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Consider performance implications of localStorage writes
- Touch conflicts with page scrolling need careful attention
