# Sprint: Sprint 2 - Project List Organization (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Implement project list sorting and organization features to help users manage large numbers of projects efficiently with persistent preferences.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Complete SPECS_PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md technical specification document
- Sort control UI components (dropdown/buttons) with responsive design
- Sorting algorithms for name (A-Z, Z-A) and total time (ascending, descending)
- Visual sort indicators with smooth transition animations
- Sort preference persistence in localStorage with versioned storage
- Integration with existing project list display without breaking changes
- Comprehensive unit tests for all sorting functionality

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can sort projects by name alphabetically in both directions (A-Z, Z-A)
- Users can sort projects by total time in ascending and descending order
- Sort controls are fully accessible and work seamlessly on mobile devices
- Visual indicators clearly display the current active sort method and direction
- User's sort preferences persist across browser sessions and application restarts
- Sorting operations complete in under 100ms for project lists up to 50 projects
- No disruption to existing project list functionality (add, delete, timer operations)
- All new sorting functionality achieves 100% unit test coverage
- Technical specification document (SPECS_PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) is complete and detailed

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint requires creation of SPECS_PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md before implementation can begin
- Builds on the existing solid project list foundation in AppComponent
- Enhances core project management capabilities with immediate user value
- Specification should match the quality and detail level of existing SPECS_DATA_EXPORT.md
- Consider future extensibility for additional sort options (creation date, last activity)
