# Sprint: Testing Accessibility - Quality Assurance & Accessibility (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Achieve comprehensive test coverage and implement accessibility features to complete the milestone.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement comprehensive unit tests with >90% code coverage for new functionality
- Add integration tests for complete drag-drop workflows
- Implement keyboard accessibility with Ctrl+Shift+↑/↓ shortcuts
- Add screen reader support and ARIA attributes
- Perform thorough regression testing for existing timer functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Performance testing and optimization validation
- Code quality review and Angular 20 best practices compliance

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Unit test coverage >90% for all new drag-drop functionality
- Integration tests cover complete drag-drop flows from start to finish
- Keyboard reordering works with Ctrl+Shift+↑/↓ shortcuts
- Screen reader announces reorder actions appropriately
- No regressions in existing timer functionality (all existing tests pass)
- Cross-browser testing confirms compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Performance testing validates 60fps animations and smooth interactions
- Code follows Angular 20 best practices and project conventions
- All DoD criteria from M01 milestone are fully satisfied

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint finalizes the milestone and ensures production readiness
- Accessibility features may be marked as "nice-to-have" if time constraints exist
- Regression testing is critical - existing functionality must not be broken
- Performance benchmarking should validate all earlier performance claims
