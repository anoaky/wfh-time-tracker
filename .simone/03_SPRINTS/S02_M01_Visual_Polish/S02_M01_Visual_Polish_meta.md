# Sprint: Visual Polish - Rich Drag-Drop Feedback (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Implement rich visual feedback system with smooth animations and professional drag-drop user experience.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement drag shadow/ghost effects (60% opacity, scaling, elevation)
- Add drop position indicators between projects (blue line)
- Create smooth 60fps animations for drag states and transitions
- Style drag preview and placeholder elements
- Add hover states and visual cues for draggable items
- Implement all animation timing specifications (150ms, 200ms, 250ms, 300ms)
- Ensure cross-browser visual consistency

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Dragged items show at 60% opacity with elevated shadow and 1.05 scale
- Drop position indicator (2px blue line) appears between projects
- All animations run smoothly at 60fps without jank
- Drag preview and placeholder styling matches design specifications
- Hover states clearly indicate draggable areas
- Animation timing follows specification (drag start: 150ms, position shifts: 200ms, etc.)
- Visual experience feels native and professional across desktop browsers
- No performance degradation during drag operations

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Builds on the working foundation from S01
- Focus is entirely on user experience and visual feedback
- Performance testing should be done during development to ensure 60fps target
- CSS transforms should be used for GPU acceleration
