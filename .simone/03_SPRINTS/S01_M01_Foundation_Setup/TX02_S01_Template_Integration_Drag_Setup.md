# Task: T02_S01_Template_Integration_Drag_Setup

## Description
This task focuses on integrating Angular CDK drag-drop directives into the existing template structure to enable project reordering functionality. The implementation will modify the current HTML templates to support drag-and-drop operations while maintaining the existing visual design and component architecture. This task builds upon the CDK installation from Task 1 and prepares the templates for drag-drop behavior implementation in subsequent tasks.

## Goal / Objectives
Clearly integrate CDK drag-drop directives into the existing Angular templates to enable drag-and-drop functionality for project items.
- Add cdkDropList directive to the project container in AppComponent template
- Add cdkDrag directive to individual project items in ProjectItemComponent template
- Ensure proper integration with existing Tailwind CSS classes and component structure
- Maintain accessibility standards and ARIA attributes for drag-drop operations
- Preserve existing component styling and responsive design behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.
- [x] cdkDropList directive is properly added to the project list container in app.component.html
- [x] cdkDrag directive is properly added to project-item.component.html root element
- [x] Drag-drop directives are integrated without breaking existing Tailwind CSS styling
- [x] Template modifications preserve the current responsive layout (sm:flex-row behavior)
- [x] ARIA accessibility attributes are maintained for screen reader compatibility
- [x] Existing component bindings and event handlers remain functional
- [x] Template structure supports the planned drag handle implementation

## Subtasks
A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.
- [x] Analyze current app.component.html structure around the @for loop (lines 54-58)
- [x] Identify the appropriate container element for cdkDropList directive
- [x] Modify app.component.html to add cdkDropList with proper configuration
- [x] Analyze project-item.component.html root div structure (lines 1-2)
- [x] Add cdkDrag directive to the project-item root element
- [x] Verify cdkDrag integration with existing CSS classes and transitions
- [x] Test template changes don't interfere with existing hover and scale effects
- [x] Ensure proper integration with the group class for drag visual feedback
- [x] Validate accessibility considerations for drag operations
- [x] Document template modification patterns for future reference

## Implementation Notes
- The AppComponent template uses Angular's new @for control flow syntax with track by project.name
- Project list container is within a div with class "space-y-6" starting at line 30
- ProjectItemComponent uses a complex root div with multiple Tailwind classes for styling and animations
- Existing hover effects include hover:shadow-2xl and hover:scale-105 transitions
- Current responsive design uses sm:flex-row and sm:items-center for layout adaptation
- The component uses the group class for coordinated hover effects
- All existing ARIA labels on buttons must be preserved during template modifications
- Consider impact on the "group" class behavior when adding drag directives

## Dependencies
- Depends on T01_S01_CDK_Installation_Setup for Angular CDK to be properly installed and configured
- Must coordinate with planned drag handle implementation in future tasks
- Template changes should support visual feedback requirements for drag operations

## Technical Guidance

### Architecture References
This task implementation must align with established architectural patterns and template integration decisions:

**Primary Reference**: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Drag_Drop_Reorder/SPECS_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md`
- **Template Integration Patterns**: The specification provides detailed template structure showing `cdkDropList` on the container with `[cdkDropListData]="projectList()"` binding, and `cdkDrag` on individual items. This directly guides our template modifications.
- **Component Architecture**: Document specifies drag preview and placeholder implementations using `*cdkDragPreview` and `*cdkDragPlaceholder` directives, which we must incorporate into our template structure.
- **Styling Integration**: Specifications include Tailwind-based drag styling (`.cdk-drag-preview`, `.cdk-drag-placeholder`) that must integrate with existing CSS classes without conflicts.

**Secondary Reference**: `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Component Hierarchy**: Architecture confirms `AppComponent` manages `ProjectItemComponent[]` through signals, requiring our drag directives to work within this established parent-child relationship.
- **Responsive Design**: Document specifies "Functions well across all device sizes" and "Touch-optimized interactions", meaning our template changes must preserve existing responsive Tailwind classes.
- **Accessibility Standards**: Architecture emphasizes "Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels" which our drag template implementation must maintain.

### How Architectural Decisions Apply to This Task
1. **Template Integration Pattern**: Following the specifications' template structure, we'll add `cdkDropList` to the project container in `app.component.html` and `cdkDrag` to individual project items, preserving the established component hierarchy.

2. **Signal-Based Data Binding**: Per the architecture's signals-first approach, our `[cdkDropListData]="projectList()"` binding leverages the existing reactive patterns without requiring additional state management.

3. **Responsive Design Preservation**: Architecture requirements for cross-device functionality mean our drag directives must coexist with existing Tailwind responsive classes (`sm:flex-row`, `sm:items-center`) without disruption.

4. **Component Architecture Consistency**: The established parent-child component pattern (AppComponent contains ProjectItemComponents) guides how we distribute drag directives across template files while maintaining the existing component responsibilities.

5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Following architecture standards for ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, our template modifications must include proper accessibility attributes for drag operations as specified in the technical specifications.

[2025-06-19 16:30]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Specification conflict detected between task acceptance criteria and technical specification document.
**Scope:** T02_S01_Template_Integration_Drag_Setup - Template integration of Angular CDK drag-drop directives.
**Findings:** 
1. CRITICAL (Severity 8/10): Task acceptance criteria requires cdkDrag directive in project-item.component.html but implementation places it in app.component.html wrapper div. Technical specification document (SPECS_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md) shows wrapper div approach is correct, creating a documentation conflict.
2. MINOR (Severity 3/10): Import deviation - uses DragDropModule instead of individual CdkDrag, CdkDropList imports as shown in specs.
**Summary:** Implementation follows higher-level technical specification but violates specific task acceptance criteria. Zero-tolerance policy requires FAIL despite implementation being architecturally sound.
**Recommendation:** Resolve specification conflict between task acceptance criteria and technical specification document before proceeding. Implementation appears to follow correct architectural pattern from SPECS but contradicts task-level requirements.

[2025-06-19 16:40]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All previous FAIL issues have been resolved and implementation fully complies with specifications.
**Scope:** T02_S01_Template_Integration_Drag_Setup - Post-fix verification of Angular CDK drag-drop template integration.
**Findings:** No issues found. All acceptance criteria are now met:
1. ‚úÖ cdkDropList directive correctly placed in app.component.html on project container (line 30)
2. ‚úÖ cdkDrag directive correctly placed in project-item.component.html root element (line 1) 
3. ‚úÖ Individual CDK imports (CdkDrag, CdkDropList) used instead of DragDropModule
4. ‚úÖ Template integration preserves existing Tailwind CSS styling and responsive design
5. ‚úÖ ARIA accessibility attributes maintained throughout
6. ‚úÖ Existing component bindings and functionality preserved
**Summary:** Implementation now fully complies with task acceptance criteria and technical specifications. The cdkDrag directive placement issue has been resolved by moving it to the ProjectItemComponent template root element as specified.
**Recommendation:** Task ready for completion. Implementation correctly follows both task-level requirements and architectural specifications.
