The testing strategy must align with existing Jasmine/Karma patterns and achieve >80% test coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust testing foundation for the drag-drop feature that ensures reliability, maintainability, and regression prevention.
- Achieve >80% test coverage for all drag-drop related functionality
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for the reorderProjects method
- Create integration tests for CDK drag-drop components
- Validate signal-based state management during reordering operations
- Ensure no regressions in existing timer functionality
- Follow established testing patterns from existing codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for AppComponent.reorderProjects() method with edge cases covered
- [ ] CDK drag-drop integration tests using Angular Testing Utilities
- [ ] Signal state validation tests for projectList updates during reordering
- [ ] Test coverage reports show >80% coverage for new drag-drop code
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- [ ] Integration tests verify drag-drop events trigger correct state changes
- [ ] Mock drag-drop events properly simulate user interactions
- [ ] Tests validate localStorage persistence after reordering
- [ ] Error handling tests for invalid drag-drop scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests ensure drag-drop operations don't degrade app performance

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze existing test patterns in app.component.spec.ts, project-item.component.spec.ts, and project-data.spec.ts
- [ ] Research Angular CDK drag-drop testing approaches and best practices
- [ ] Create unit tests for reorderProjects method covering:
  - Valid reordering scenarios (different positions)
  - Edge cases (same position, invalid indices)
  - Signal state updates and reactivity
  - localStorage persistence after reordering
- [ ] Implement CDK drag-drop integration tests:
  - Mock CdkDragDrop events using Angular testing utilities
  - Test drop event handling and data transfer
  - Validate visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] Create signal-based state testing:
  - Test projectList signal updates during reordering
  - Verify computed projectNames signal updates correctly
  - Test Angular effects trigger localStorage saves
- [ ] Implement regression testing:
  - Ensure existing timer functionality remains unaffected
  - Verify add/delete project operations work with reordering
  - Test form validation and duplicate prevention still work
- [ ] Add integration testing for complete drag-drop workflows:
  - End-to-end reordering scenarios
  - Multiple project reordering sequences
  - Interaction between drag-drop and other app features
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting and validate >80% threshold
- [ ] Document testing patterns and guidelines for future drag-drop features

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Existing Testing Infrastructure
The codebase uses Angular 19's testing framework with:
- **Framework**: Jasmine for test specifications and Karma for test running
- **Angular Testing**: ComponentFixture, TestBed, fakeAsync, tick for async testing
- **Test Configuration**: ChromeHeadless browser via @angular/build:karma
- **Signal Testing**: Existing patterns show direct signal manipulation and state verification
- **Mocking**: localStorage mocking patterns established in app.component.spec.ts

### CDK Drag-Drop Testing Strategy
Reference Angular CDK documentation and testing patterns:
- **Event Simulation**: Use Angular's DebugElement to trigger drag events
- **Mock Objects**: Create mock CdkDragDrop events with proper data structure
- **Component Testing**: Test both template interactions and component method calls
- **State Validation**: Verify projectList signal updates match expected reordering

### Signal Testing Patterns
Follow established patterns from existing tests:
- **Direct Signal Access**: Use component.projectList() to read current state
- **Signal Updates**: Use component.projectList.set() and .update() for state changes
- **Effect Testing**: Use fixture.detectChanges() to trigger Angular effects
- **Computed Signal Testing**: Verify projectNames computed signal updates correctly

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Method Coverage**: All reorderProjects method branches and conditions
- **Integration Coverage**: CDK directive integration and event handling
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Invalid indices, empty lists, single item lists
- **Error Handling**: Malformed drag events, invalid data structures
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure reordering large lists doesn't cause performance issues

### Dependencies and References
- **Task Dependencies**: Must be implemented after Task 3 (T03_S01_Core_Implementation)
- **Existing Test Files**: 
  - /src/app/app.component.spec.ts (310 lines, comprehensive AppComponent testing)
  - /src/app/project-item/project-item.component.spec.ts (timer and component testing)
  - /src/app/project-data.spec.ts (data model testing)
- **CDK Documentation**: Angular CDK drag-drop testing documentation
- **Sprint Requirements**: Must validate sprint Definition of Done criteria

### Quality Assurance Standards
- **Test Naming**: Follow existing descriptive test naming conventions
- **Test Structure**: Use established beforeEach/afterEach patterns for setup/cleanup
- **Async Testing**: Use fakeAsync/tick patterns for timer-related functionality
- **Mock Strategy**: Follow localStorage mocking patterns from existing tests
- **Test Organization**: Group related tests using describe blocks
- **Assertion Patterns**: Use expect() assertions following existing codebase style

## Technical Guidance

### Architecture References
This task implementation must align with established testing architecture and quality standards:

**Primary Reference**: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Drag_Drop_Reorder/SPECS_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md`
- **Testing Strategy Specifications**: Document provides detailed unit test examples for `reorderProjects` method and CDK integration testing patterns using `fakeAsync` and `tick` for debounced localStorage operations.
- **CDK-Specific Testing**: Specifications include integration test patterns for `CdkDragDrop` event simulation using `TestBed.createComponent` and `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` methods that guide our testing approach.
- **Performance Testing Requirements**: Document specifies memory management and performance optimization tests, including cleanup of drag subscriptions and validation of animation performance impacts.

**Secondary Reference**: `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Testing Architecture Framework**: Architecture confirms "Jasmine + Karma" with "Component behavior, data flow, validation logic" coverage categories and specific test pattern examples that our drag-drop tests must follow.
- **Signal Testing Patterns**: Document shows testing approach for signal-based state management with "Component initialization, User interaction flows, State management" test categories directly applicable to our drag-drop testing.
- **Quality Standards**: Architecture specifies "Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability" with established patterns for testing localStorage persistence, signal updates, and component interactions.

### How Architectural Decisions Apply to This Task
1. **Testing Framework Consistency**: Following architecture's Jasmine/Karma framework with established test patterns, our drag-drop tests must use the same `beforeEach`/`afterEach`, `fakeAsync`/`tick`, and component fixture patterns shown in existing test files.

2. **Signal-Based Test Architecture**: Per the architecture's signals-first approach, our tests must validate signal state changes using direct signal access (`component.projectList()`) and signal update methods (`.set()`/`.update()`) following established patterns.

3. **Quality Coverage Standards**: Architecture emphasizes comprehensive testing with specific categories (component initialization, user interactions, state management, persistence, error handling) that our drag-drop tests must address to maintain project quality standards.

4. **Integration Test Strategy**: Following architecture's component hierarchy (AppComponent manages ProjectItemComponent array), our integration tests must validate drag-drop functionality across this established component relationship structure.

5. **Performance Test Requirements**: Architecture targets of "60fps smooth" and "zero perceptible lag" require performance testing for drag operations to ensure they don't compromise the established performance benchmarks.

6. **localStorage Testing Patterns**: Architecture's persistence strategy through localStorage effects requires testing debounced saves and data integrity, following established localStorage mocking patterns from existing test suites.

7. **Error Handling Standards**: Architecture emphasizes "Graceful fallback for corrupted data" requiring our tests to validate drag-drop error scenarios (invalid indices, malformed events) following established error handling test patterns.
