# Task: T01_S01_Project_Setup_CDK_Integration

## Description
Setup git branch structure and integrate Angular CDK drag-drop module to enable drag-and-drop functionality for project reordering in the work-from-home time tracker application. This task establishes the foundation for enhanced user interaction by allowing users to reorder their project list through drag-and-drop operations.

## Goal / Objectives
Prepare the codebase for drag-and-drop functionality by integrating the necessary Angular CDK dependencies and establishing proper branch management.
- Integrate Angular CDK drag-drop module into the existing Angular 20 project
- Create appropriate git branch structure from current main branch
- Configure project dependencies and module imports
- Ensure compatibility with existing signals-based architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Angular CDK package is installed and properly configured in package.json
- [ ] Git branch 'feature/cdk-drag-drop-integration' is created from main branch
- [ ] CDK drag-drop module is imported in app.config.ts or relevant module files
- [ ] Project builds successfully without errors after CDK integration
- [ ] CDK dependencies are compatible with Angular 20.0.4 and existing project structure
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect new dependencies

## Subtasks
- [x] Create feature branch 'feature/cdk-drag-drop-integration' from main branch
- [x] Install @angular/cdk package via npm with appropriate version compatibility
- [x] Update package.json to include Angular CDK as a dependency
- [x] Import DragDropModule in app.config.ts providers or relevant configuration
- [x] Verify compatibility with existing signal-based architecture (AppComponent signals)
- [x] Update angular.json if necessary for CDK assets or styles
- [x] Test build process to ensure no conflicts with existing dependencies
- [x] Verify integration with Tailwind CSS styling system
- [x] Confirm localStorage persistence still functions correctly
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect CDK integration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Package Dependencies
- Current Angular version: 20.0.4
- Target CDK version: Should match Angular core version (^20.0.0)
- Package installation command: `npm install @angular/cdk`
- Verify compatibility with existing dependencies: rxjs ~7.8.0, zone.js ~0.15.0

### Git Branch Strategy
- Source branch: main (currently on main, confirmed clean status)
- New branch: feature/cdk-drag-drop-integration
- Branch creation: `git checkout -b feature/cdk-drag-drop-integration`

### Angular Configuration Updates
- Primary configuration file: src/app/app.config.ts
- Import statement: `import { DragDropModule } from '@angular/cdk/drag-drop';`
- Provider configuration: Add to imports array in bootstrapApplication or component imports
- Component integration: Update AppComponent imports array to include DragDropModule

### Architecture Considerations
- Existing structure uses signals-based reactive architecture
- AppComponent manages projectList as WritableSignal<ProjectData[]>
- ProjectItemComponent handles individual project display
- Drag-drop will need to integrate with existing update patterns for projectList signal
- localStorage autosave effect should continue to work with reordered projects

### Build System Compatibility
- Angular builder: @angular/build:application (version 20.0.3)
- No expected conflicts with existing build configuration
- Tailwind CSS integration should remain unaffected
- Test framework (Karma/Jasmine) compatibility maintained

### File Structure Impact
- No new directories required for basic CDK integration
- Existing component structure (app/, add-project-form/, project-item/) remains unchanged
- Configuration changes limited to app.config.ts and package.json

## Technical Guidance

### Architecture References
This task implementation must align with established architectural patterns and decisions documented in the project's architecture guidance:

**Primary Reference**: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Drag_Drop_Reorder/SPECS_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md`
- **CDK Choice Rationale**: The specification confirms Angular CDK was selected over custom implementation for robust cross-platform support, accessibility features, and reduced maintenance burden. This task establishes the foundation for that architectural decision.
- **Implementation Approach**: Document specifies using `CdkDrag` and `CdkDropList` modules with touch/mouse event consistency, which guides our package installation and import strategy.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Specifications note Angular 20 requirement eliminates IE11 support, allowing us to use modern CDK features without legacy concerns.

**Secondary Reference**: `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Angular Framework Decision**: Architecture document confirms Angular 20 with signals-based architecture was chosen as a learning platform for modern Angular practices. Our CDK integration must not compromise this signals-first approach.
- **Standalone Components**: The project uses standalone components without NgModules, requiring us to import CDK modules directly in component imports arrays rather than through NgModule declarations.
- **Technology Stack Alignment**: CDK integration must maintain compatibility with TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS v4, and existing RxJS dependencies as specified in the architecture stack.

### How Architectural Decisions Apply to This Task
1. **CDK Selection**: The architecture specifies CDK for accessibility and cross-platform support. This task implements that decision by installing the CDK package and establishing import patterns that subsequent tasks will build upon.

2. **Signals Integration**: Per architecture guidance on "Angular's latest reactive primitives", our CDK setup must integrate with the existing `projectList` WritableSignal without disrupting the established patterns.

3. **Standalone Architecture**: Following the "Modern Angular architecture without NgModules" principle, we'll configure CDK imports in app.config.ts providers or component-level imports, not traditional module declarations.

4. **Performance Requirements**: Architecture targets include "60fps smooth" timer updates and "zero perceptible lag". Our CDK foundation must not introduce performance regressions that conflict with these targets.
